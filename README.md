I am working In soft drink distributing company (Dr Pepper). 
Me and my coworkers drive in st louis and look stores what kind of product they need
in the shelf we are 5 in numbers but we have more than 100 stores in the state 
we donâ€™t have a common program that help as connect who went to which store to 
work and who did the right order and who did which store  I went to build a project which simplifies this issue 

My project will have:
 User login 
User comment 
Product list
Product search

I will use:
Java 
Spring Boot
MYSQL
HTML
templates
